# TTAC

This repository is an official implementation for our NeurIPS 2022 paper [\[Arxiv\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02721) [\[Openreview\]](https://openreview.net/forum?id=W-_4hgRkwb).

We implement a plug and play version of TTAC without queue on another work [repo](https://github.com/Gorilla-Lab-SCUT/TRIBE/blob/master/core/adapter/ttac.py).
